;17 x 8 by int value power of 2
;slli shift left logical immediate

addi	x6, x0, 17	
slli	x5, x6, 2	;slli immd value of 2 shifts x6's bits twice so multuply by 4
			;feeding zeros to LSB
			;each 1-bit shift to left multplies by 2
			; so 2 produce 2 shifts to multuply by 4
			;so 2^2 = 4 -> 17x4
